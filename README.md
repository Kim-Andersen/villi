### Server scripts

- `npm run migrate [up|down]` runs database migrations.
- `npm run migrate seed` runs database seeds.

### Database
#### Seeds

Seeds are database queries that insert seed data.

Each seed is defiend in a `.sql` file in the `server/seeds` directory and must be added to `server/seeds/seeds.json` in order to get executed when running `npm run seed` in the `server` directory.

## Environement Variables
- `PORT`: server port.
- `DATABASE_URL`: Postgres database connection string.
- `GEOCODER_API_KEY`: used with the `node-geocoder` module.

- `NC_OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`
- `NC_OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`


### Travis CI

A `NC_DEPLOY_TOKEN` environment variable must be added to Travis environment variables.
